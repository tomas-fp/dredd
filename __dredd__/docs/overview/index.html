    This file exists only to redirect from old URL to new URL.
    This is more properly done using an HTTP redirect, but unfortunately
    readthedocs.org's page redirection is broken (see
    https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1826). Once that bug is
    fixed, the file can be removed.
