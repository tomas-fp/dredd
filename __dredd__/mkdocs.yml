# These extra_templates exists only to redirect from old URLs to new URLs.
# This is more properly done using an HTTP redirect, but unfortunately
# readthedocs.org's page redirection is broken (see
# https://github.com/rtfd/readthedocs.org/issues/1826). Once that bug is fixed,
# these files can be removed.
